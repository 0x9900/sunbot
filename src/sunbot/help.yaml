kindex: >-
  The K-index, and by extension the Planetary K-index, are used to characterize
  the magnitude of geomagnetic storms. Kp is an excellent indicator of
  disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field and is used by SWPC to decide
  whether geomagnetic alerts and warnings need to be issued for users who are
  affected by these disturbances.

  The principal users affected by geomagnetic storms are the electrical power
  grid, spacecraft operations, users of radio signals that reflect off of or
  pass through the ionosphere, and observers of the aurora.

aindex: >-
  The A and K indices show the fluctuations in the magnetic field, tied to
  specific geographic locations.  The indices have a range from 0 to 9 and are
  directly related to the maximum amount of fluctuation (relative to a quiet
  day) in the geomagnetic field over a three-hour interval. The A and K index
  inpact GPS Systems, Electric Power, HF Radio Communications, Satellite
  Communications.

Flux: >-
  The solar radio flux at 10.7 cm (2800 MHz) indicates solar activity. It is one
  of the longest-running records of solar activity. The Solar Flux correlates
  with the sunspot number. Reported in "solar flux units" (SFU), the Solar Flux
  varies from below 50 SFU to above 300 SFU throughout a solar cycle.

MUF: >-
  The Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) is the highest radio frequency that can be
  used for transmission between two stations on Earth by reflection from the
  ionosphere (skywave or skip) at a specified time, independent of transmitter
  power. This index is especially useful for HF transmissions.

Proton: >-
  The radiation storm caused by energetic solar protons, can disrupt HF radio
  communication. The protons collide with the upper atmosphere near the north
  and south poles. The fast-moving protons enhance the D-Layer blocking HF radio
  communication at high latitudes.

XRays: >-
  During a solar flare, the x-rays are the first impacts felt. They penetrate to
  the bottom of the ionosphere (to around 80 km). The X-ray photons ionize the
  atmosphere and enhance the ionosphere's D layer. This enhanced D-layer acts as
  a reflector of radio waves at some frequencies and an absorber of waves at
  other frequencies. The Radio Blackout associated with solar flares occurs on
  the dayside region of Earth and is most intense when the sun is directly
  overhead.

SunSpots: >-
  Sunspots directly impact radio propagation on Earth. These dark, cooler regions
  on the sun's surface create heightened solar activity, affecting the ionosphere
  and its ability to reflect and refract radio signals. When sunspot numbers are
  high, the increased ionization allows for longer-distance and more reliable
  communication. Conversely, signal strength and propagation conditions can
  become challenging during low sunspot activity.

Wind: >-
  The solar wind, emitted from the sun in Earth's direction, impacts the
  atmosphere and the planet's magnetic fields. It causes events such as auroras.
  They can also wreak havoc on communications, disturbing the Earth's
  electromagnetic field and distorting radio transmission. Severe solar wind can
  also affect power grids, causing fluctuations and blackouts.
